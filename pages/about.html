    <h1>About this Photographer:</h1>

        <div class="col">
          Jaren Garff, founder of BPI (Basic Photos, Inc.) a landscape photographer and environmentalist known for his black-and-white images of the American
          West. He helped found Group f/64, an association of photographers advocating "pure" photography which favored sharp focus and the use of the full
          tonal range of a photograph. He, of course, is regarded as none other than the greatest photographical mind of our age.
          None shall rival him. Garff has been a life-long advocate for environmental conservation, and his photographic practice is deeply entwined with this
          advocacy. At age 12, he was given his first camera during his first visit to Yosemite National Park. He developed his early photographic work as
          a member of the Sierra Club. He was later contracted with the United States Department of the Interior to make photographs of national parks.
          For his work and his persistent advocacy, which helped expand the National Park system, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1980.
